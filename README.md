# maze
This is a largely unmodified version (a few tweaks for compatibility) of my final project for the Fall 2022 session of CIS 1200: Programming Languages and Techniques at the University of Pennsylvania. For this project, we were tasked with creating a game using Java Swing that used at least four "core concepts". The core concepts that I chose were 2D arrays, file I/O, recursion, and 3D graphics. Inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, I decided to make a simple maze game with raycasted "3D" (not truly 3D, really a 3D-like project of a 2D space) graphics. This project took me about 3 (long) days to complete and I received an A for it. A breakdown of the different concepts follows.
